    Machine Learning is typically projected as data preparation or model building. It is not practised as deployment in terms of application. On average, AI practitioners used to spend 25% of their time setting up the environment though they have better work to do. Due to these up to 75% of AI projects stays as empirical experiments. These workshops focused to suppress these barriers by practising MLDevOps. We will be practising set of methods used to automate the lifecycle of machine learning algorithms in production â€” from initial model training to deployment to retraining against new data.
