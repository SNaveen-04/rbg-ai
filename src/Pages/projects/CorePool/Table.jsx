            Since the Badaga language is not officially written in any native script, we have manually created 2100 Badaga transcripts written in English slang with their corresponding translation in English. 12 native speakers spoke these text sets and recorded. Both annotated and unannotated corpus was released as wave files with a sampling rate of 22050 Hz and PCM 16-bit rate. The annotated corpus was constructed carefully to include the word variations which include, food items, utensils, proverbs, insects, flowers, animals, colors, numbers, days, weeks, months, fruits, common places, action words, and vehicle types. The unannotated corpus has been collated by taking data from Youtube. The genre includes musical songs, short films, and talk shows.
